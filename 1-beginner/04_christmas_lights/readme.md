# Christmas Lights

The Christmas Lights application relies on one's development talents to create a mesmerizing light display. The task is to draw several colored circles in a row and based on a timer change the intensity of each circle. When a circle is brightened it's predecessor returns to its normal intensity. This simulates the effect of a string of rippling lights, similar to the ones displayed during the Christmas Holidays.
