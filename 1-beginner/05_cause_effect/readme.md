# CauseEffect

A common user interface pattern is to summarize data in one section of a page that consists of some type of list (like text, images, or icons) that describes or categorizes a set of data. When a list item is clicked, the detailed data behind it is displayed in an adjacent pane on the page. Demo can be found [here](https://jamoliddinsaidov.github.io/practice-projects/1-beginner/05_cause_effect/index.html).
